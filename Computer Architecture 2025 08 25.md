Here is a corrected, fully explained version organized in sections. I fix factual and logical errors, standardize terms, and expand the reasoning. I do not summarize.

# 1) Course logistics (clarified)

* Homework 1 releases before 5:00 p.m. and is due the following Tuesday, with a standard one-day grace period.
* Work individually. Discussion is allowed. If you use AI tools, state that in your answers.
* Instructor and TA office hours begin this week.
* Meeting time stated as “700 p.m.” means 7:00 p.m.

# 2) Amdahl’s Law (correct statement and example)

**Definition.** If a fraction (f) of execution time is improved by a factor (s), the new execution time is
[
T_{\text{new}} = T_{\text{old}}\big[(1-f) + \frac{f}{s}\big]
]
and the overall speedup is
[
\text{Speedup} = \frac{T_{\text{old}}}{T_{\text{new}}} = \frac{1}{(1-f)+f/s}.
]

**Example.** If 10% of time ((f=0.10)) runs twice as fast ((s=2)):
[
T_{\text{new}} = T_{\text{old}}[(0.9) + 0.1/2] = 0.95,T_{\text{old}},
]
so
[
\text{Speedup} = 1/0.95 \approx 1.0526.
]
That is a **5.26%** speedup, not “5% of the original time.” The *improved part* shrinks by half; the *program* speeds up by ~5.26%.

# 3) CPU performance equation (precise form)

Two equivalent forms:
[
\boxed{T_{\text{CPU}} = \text{Instruction Count (IC)} \times \text{CPI} \times t_{\text{clk}}}
]
[
\boxed{T_{\text{CPU}} = \frac{\text{IC} \times \text{CPI}}{\text{Clock Rate}}}, \quad \text{with } t_{\text{clk}}=\frac{1}{\text{Clock Rate}}.
]
The split into CPI and clock period is useful because different design choices affect them differently.

# 4) What controls Instruction Count (IC)

* **Algorithm + programmer:** Better algorithms and code eliminate work.
* **Compiler:** Optimization levels (e.g., `-O0`, `-O1`, `-O2`, `-O3`) restructure code, inline, unroll, vectorize, eliminate dead code; IC often drops as optimization rises.
* **Instruction Set Architecture (ISA):** Richer instructions can reduce IC. Example: AES instructions (Intel AES-NI, ARM Cryptography Extensions) replace long software sequences with a few instructions.

  * Caveat: Fewer instructions does not guarantee faster runtime. CPI and clock period also change.

# 5) What controls CPI (cycles per instruction)

CPI is an **average** over all dynamic instructions:
[
\boxed{\text{CPI}_{\text{avg}} = \sum_i \big(\text{fraction of class } i\big)\times \text{CPI}_i}
]
Common influences:

## 5.1 Microarchitecture

* **Pipelining:** Breaks instruction processing into stages (Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory, Writeback). Increases instruction overlap and reduces **effective** CPI toward ~1 for simple in-order designs when hazards are minimal.
* **Caches:** Cut memory access latency. Example latencies: L1 ~ a few cycles; main memory ~ O(100) cycles. Caches lower stall cycles, reducing CPI for loads/stores.
* **Branch prediction:** Reduces control hazards and misprediction penalties, lowering CPI.
* **Out-of-order execution, register renaming, multiple issue:** Hide latencies and increase instructions retired per cycle, lowering effective CPI.
* **Functional unit design:** Faster adders/multipliers or more units can reduce execution cycles or contention.

## 5.2 ISA characteristics

* **Instruction complexity:** A single complex instruction may need multiple cycles internally, raising CPI for that class. A simpler ISA may use more instructions with lower per-instruction CPI.

## 5.3 Compiler scheduling

* **Instruction scheduling:** Reorders independent instructions to fill latency “holes.” Example: Separate a `load` from its consumer by enough independent work to hide memory latency, reducing *observed* CPI.
* **Vectorization and unrolling:** Increase useful work per issued instruction and reduce control overhead, often lowering CPI.

# 6) What controls clock cycle time (t_{\text{clk}}) (and clock rate)

* **Process technology:** Smaller, faster transistors can support a **shorter** clock period (higher frequency). The transcript’s “smaller clock” phrasing was imprecise; the correct term is *shorter clock period*.
* **Microarchitecture and pipeline balance:** The clock period must be at least as long as the slowest pipeline stage plus overheads (latches, clock skew). Deeper pipelines can raise frequency but increase penalties on hazards and mispredictions.
* **ISA (indirectly):** Very complex decoding can lengthen the decode stage unless further subdivided, potentially lengthening (t_{\text{clk}}).

**Historical note.** The “megahertz myth” era: Intel NetBurst (Pentium 4) deepened pipelines (≈20–31 stages) to raise frequency, but IPC dropped due to higher misprediction penalties and other effects. Higher GHz did not guarantee higher **performance** because ( \text{Perf} \propto \text{Clock Rate} / (\text{IC}\times\text{CPI}) ), and CPI worsened.

# 7) ISA vs microarchitecture vs implementation details

* **ISA:** The contract visible to compilers/assembly (registers, instructions, semantics). Example: x86, ARM, MIPS, RISC-V.
* **Microarchitecture:** How the ISA is realized (pipeline depth, caches, predictors, OoO, execution units).
* **Implementation circuits:** Gate-level choices (e.g., ripple-carry vs carry-lookahead adder). These choices influence stage delays and power; they are below the ISA and often considered part of implementation that supports the chosen microarchitecture.

**CISC front end with RISC-like core.** Modern x86 decodes complex CISC instructions into simpler micro-ops internally. Externally CISC, internally scheduled similarly to RISC-style µops.

# 8) Branch instruction design example: MIPS vs RISC-V (corrected)

* **MIPS32 classic:** Does **not** have a real `blt` instruction. Assemblers offer `blt` as a *pseudo-instruction* that expands to:

  * `slt r3, r1, r2`  // set r3 = (r1<r2)?1:0
  * `bne r3, $zero, L1`
* **RISC-V:** Has real compare-and-branch opcodes such as `blt rs1, rs2, L1`. No extra `slt` is needed for simple relational branches.

The transcript’s “risk file / disk file” refers to **RISC-V**, an open ISA. Using RISC-V does not require paying ISA licensing fees. Purchasing third-party microarchitecture IP is a separate business choice.

# 9) Worked problem: Two branch ISAs, frequency difference, and mix (full derivation)

**Given.**

* **CPU A (MIPS-style):**

  * Branches are implemented as two instructions: `slt` then a branch.
  * CPI: branch instructions take 2 cycles; all **other** instructions take 1 cycle. The `slt` counts as “other” here.
  * Dynamic mix on A: 20% branch, 20% `slt` compares (paired one-for-one with branches), 60% other.
* **CPU B (RISC-V-style):**

  * A single compare-and-branch instruction replaces the pair.
  * CPI: that branch instruction takes 2 cycles; all other instructions take 1 cycle.
* **Clock rate:** A runs **1.25×** faster than B ((f_A = 1.25,f_B)). Therefore (t_A = t_B/1.25 = 0.8,t_B).

We compare **execution time** (T = \text{IC}\times\text{CPI}\times t_{\text{clk}}).

## 9.1 Instruction Count

Let (\text{IC}_A) be A’s dynamic instruction count for the workload.

On A, each high-level branch uses two instructions (one `slt`, one branch). The transcript states that on A, 20% of **executed** instructions are branches and (by design) another 20% are the matching `slt`s. If we “fuse” each pair into one on B, we remove all those `slt`s:

[
\text{IC}_B = \text{IC}_A - 0.20,\text{IC}_A = 0.80,\text{IC}_A.
]

## 9.2 Average CPI on each CPU

* **CPU A:**
  [
  \text{CPI}_A = (0.20)\times 2;+;(0.20)\times 1;+;(0.60)\times 1
  = 0.40+0.20+0.60 = 1.20.
  ]
* **CPU B:**
  The fused branch count equals A’s branch count, i.e., (0.20,\text{IC}_A). As a **fraction of B’s** instruction stream, that is
  [
  \frac{0.20,\text{IC}_A}{\text{IC}_B}=\frac{0.20}{0.80}=0.25.
  ]
  B has 25% branches (CPI 2) and 75% others (CPI 1):
  [
  \text{CPI}_B = (0.25)\times 2 + (0.75)\times 1 = 0.50 + 0.75 = 1.25.
  ]

## 9.3 Clock period ratio

Given (f_A = 1.25,f_B), periods relate as (t_A = 0.8,t_B).

## 9.4 Execution time ratio and relative performance

[
\frac{T_A}{T_B} ;=; \frac{\text{IC}_A}{\text{IC}_B}\times \frac{\text{CPI}_A}{\text{CPI}_B}\times \frac{t_A}{t_B}
= \frac{1}{0.80}\times \frac{1.20}{1.25}\times 0.80.
]
Compute stepwise:

* (\frac{1}{0.80} = 1.25)
* (\frac{1.20}{1.25} = 0.96)
* Multiply: (1.25 \times 0.96 \times 0.80 = 0.96).

Thus
[
\boxed{\frac{T_A}{T_B} = 0.96}.
]
CPU A’s time is 96% of CPU B’s time, so A is faster by about **4%**. Equivalently,
[
\text{Perf}(A)/\text{Perf}(B) = T_B/T_A \approx 1/0.96 \approx 1.0417.
]

**Interpretation.** B cuts instruction count by 20%, but its average CPI rises slightly (more of its stream are 2-cycle branches), and its clock is slower. In this setup A wins by ~4%. Different mixes, CPI costs, or a smaller frequency gap could flip the result.

# 10) Terminology fixes from the transcript

* “Amdall/Armul” → **Amdahl’s** Law.
* “floatingoint” → floating-point.
* “CPR/grammar prediction” → **CPI/branch prediction**.
* “MOS law” → **Moore’s law** (transistor counts). Frequency/voltage scaling history is **Dennard scaling**.
* “ADM machine / ML procrosser” → **ATM machine / embedded processor**.
* “risk vs” / “risk file / disk file” → **RISC vs CISC** and **RISC-V**.
* “clock smaller” → **shorter clock period** or **higher frequency**.

# 11) Key structural relationships (explicit equations)

* **Performance** (\propto \dfrac{\text{Clock Rate}}{\text{IC}\times\text{CPI}}).
* **Amdahl bound:** diminishing returns when (f) is small or already optimized.
* **Weighted CPI:** (\text{CPI}_{\text{avg}} = \sum_i p_i,\text{CPI}_i), with (p_i) the dynamic fraction of class (i).
* **Frequency vs pipeline:** Deeper pipelines can reduce (t_{\text{clk}}) but often increase CPI via larger hazard penalties.

Here is a corrected, fully explained version organized in sections. I fix factual and logical errors, standardize terms, and expand the reasoning. I do not summarize.

# 1) Continue the A vs B branch design example (numbers made explicit)

**Setup recap.**

* **CPU A (MIPS-style):** Each high-level branch is two instructions: `slt` + conditional branch. Branches have CPI=2. All other instructions (including `slt`) have CPI=1. Mix on A: 20% branches, 20% compares (`slt`), 60% other.
* **CPU B (RISC-V-style):** One fused compare-and-branch. Fused branch has CPI=2. All other instructions CPI=1.
* **Clock rate:** (f_A = 1.25\times f_B) → (t_A = 0.8,t_B).

**Instruction count.** Let (\text{IC}_A) be A’s count. B removes the separate `slt`s: (\text{IC}_B=0.8,\text{IC}_A).
**Average CPI.**

* A: (\text{CPI}_A = 0.20\cdot 2 + 0.20\cdot 1 + 0.60\cdot 1 = 1.20).
* B: branch fraction becomes (0.20/0.80=0.25). (\text{CPI}_B=0.25\cdot 2+0.75\cdot 1=1.25).
  **Execution time ratio.**
  [
  \frac{T_A}{T_B}=\frac{\text{IC}_A}{\text{IC}_B}\cdot\frac{\text{CPI}_A}{\text{CPI}_B}\cdot\frac{t_A}{t_B}
  =\frac{1}{0.80}\cdot\frac{1.20}{1.25}\cdot 0.80
  =0.96.
  ]
  A is ~4% faster ((\text{Perf}_A/\text{Perf}_B\approx 1/0.96\approx 1.042)).
  **Why 1.25×0.80 = 1 matters.** The frequency advantage of A and the instruction-count advantage of B cancel if considered alone; CPI decides the winner. Here B’s higher branch share (25%) raises its CPI slightly, so A wins with these parameters. Small changes in frequency gap or mixes can flip the result.

# 2) Computing average CPI correctly

Use a weighted average over dynamic instruction classes:
[
\boxed{\text{CPI}_{\text{avg}}=\sum_i p_i\cdot \text{CPI}_i},\quad \sum_i p_i=1.
]
When instruction counts change (e.g., fusing a compare+branch), recompute the **fractions** (p_i) on the **new** dynamic stream before averaging.

# 3) ISA review: operands, addressing, and classes of instructions

**Operands.** Inputs and destination(s) of an instruction (e.g., `add r1, r2, r3` has three register operands).
**Addressing modes.** How an instruction specifies where operands live. Examples: register, immediate, base+offset for memory (`lw r1, 12(r2)`), PC-relative for branches.
**Registers vs memory.**

* Registers are a small, explicitly named set close to the core. They are read/written within a pipeline stage **in one cycle**. Not “less than a cycle.”
* Caches hold recently used memory lines. Even L1 typically costs multiple cycles and is not a direct operand namespace.
* Reasons registers exist even with caches: lower latency, higher multiported bandwidth to the ALUs, compact encodings (few bits to name a register vs full addresses), lower energy per access, precise compiler-visible state.

**Instruction classes.**

* **Compute:** integer/fp add, sub, mul, logic, shifts, vector ops.
* **Data movement:** register-to-register moves, and **load/store** between memory and registers. “Load” means read from memory into a register. “Store” means write a register value to memory.
* **Control transfer:** conditional branches, unconditional jumps, calls/returns.
* **System/privileged:** enter/leave kernel or hypervisor and configure protection state. Examples: x86 `syscall`/`sysret` or `sysenter`/`sysexit`; MIPS `syscall`; RISC-V `ecall`/`sret`.

# 4) ISA design considerations (what to optimize for)

* **Compiler usability:** Expose primitives compilers can recognize and exploit regularly. Esoteric “do-everything” opcodes that compilers rarely match are wasted.
* **Code size vs performance:** Small encodings help instruction-cache footprint. Historically critical; still relevant for embedded.
* **Implementation cost:** Complex, irregular semantics inflate decode and critical paths. This can lengthen the clock period or force deeper pipelines.
* **Backward compatibility:** Keeps old binaries running. x86 is complex largely to preserve this.
* **Extensibility:** Clean base ISA plus optional extensions (e.g., RISC-V’s modular design: I,M,A,F,D,C,V,S).

# 5) “32-bit” vs instruction length (disentangled)

* **“32-bit architecture”** usually means 32-bit general-purpose registers and a 32-bit **virtual address** space (up to (2^{32}) bytes = 4 GiB). Valid byte addresses run from 0 to (2^{32}-1).
* **Instruction length** is separate.

  * Fixed-length RISCs often use 32-bit encodings, with optional **compressed** 16-bit encodings (e.g., RISC-V “C”).
  * x86 uses **variable-length** encodings: 1–15 bytes per instruction.
    It is incorrect to equate “32-bit ISA” with “all instructions are 32 bits long.”

# 6) RISC vs CISC: historical drivers and today’s reality

**Classic CISC** allowed memory-operand arithmetic (e.g., “add memory to register in one instruction”), mainly to save code bytes when registers were few and memory was not much slower than the CPU.
**Classic RISC** enforced **load/store**: move to registers, compute in registers, store results. This simplifies pipelines, improves frequency, and eases scheduling.
**Modern cores** blur the line. Example: x86 decoders translate complex instructions into simpler **micro-ops** scheduled and executed RISC-style. Architecturally CISC, microarchitecturally RISC-like.

# 7) Corrections to specific misstatements in the transcript

* “CBI/PCI/CPR” → **CPI** (cycles per instruction).
* “Amdall/Armul” → **Amdahl’s** Law.
* “clock smaller” → **shorter clock period** or **higher frequency**.
* “Registers are less than a cycle” → register file reads/writes occur **within** a cycle, not “less than.”
* “Addresses from 0 through 4 GB” → for 32-bit VA, addresses are 0 to (2^{32}-1) (4 GiB).
* “Caches tag with process ID” → typical data caches are tagged with **physical addresses**; separation across processes comes from address translation and, where used, **ASIDs** in the TLB. VIPT designs rely on TLB translation to check tags; they do not normally tag lines with a PID.
* “SIS call / SIS return” → **system call** entry/return. E.g., x86 `syscall/sysret`, RISC-V `ecall/sret`, MIPS `syscall/eret`.
* “risk file / disk file” → **RISC-V** (open ISA).
* “lips” → **MIPS**.
* Historical rationale: early on, memory vs CPU speed gap was smaller and register files were smaller. Later, the **memory wall** grew and RISCs added many registers; compilers favored load/store.
* Fragment “There’s also exactly one x86 processor” is false and incomplete. Major x86-64 vendors include **Intel** and **AMD**; others have existed (e.g., VIA/Centaur/Zhaoxin).

# 8) Context switching and state (clarified)

On a context switch the OS saves **architectural registers** of the outgoing process and restores those for the incoming process. Caches and TLBs may be retained to avoid cold misses; TLBs may be flushed or switched using **ASIDs**. This behavior is independent of the necessity of architectural registers in the ISA.

# 9) Why registers even with good caches (concise list)

* Latency: register file access completes within one cycle; L1 cache is multi-cycle.
* Bandwidth: multiported register files feed several ALUs per cycle; caches rarely offer that many read/write ports.
* Encoding: naming registers costs few bits; naming memory needs addresses and adds dependencies on loads.
* Energy: registers cost less energy per operand than cache reads.
* Determinism: ALU operands are directly available without miss penalties.

# 10) Branches, jumps, and loops (precise terms)

* **Conditional branch:** decides based on flags or register compare (e.g., MIPS pseudo `blt`, real RISC-V `blt`).
* **Unconditional jump:** always transfers control (e.g., loop back-edge).
* **Call/return:** transfer to subroutine and come back; often use a link register or stack return address.

# 11) Performance equation to apply going forward

[
\boxed{T_{\text{CPU}}=\text{IC}\times\text{CPI}\times t_{\text{clk}}}
\quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad
\boxed{\text{Perf}\propto \frac{\text{Clock Rate}}{\text{IC}\times\text{CPI}}}
]
When comparing designs, analyze **all three** terms. Cutting IC can raise CPI or lengthen (t_{\text{clk}}). Faster clocks can raise CPI (deeper pipelines, higher branch penalties). Weighted CPI must reflect the **new** instruction mix after any ISA change.
